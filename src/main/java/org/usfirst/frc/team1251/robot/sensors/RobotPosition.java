/**
 * Represents the bot's coordinates and heaing.
 *
 * All values are relative to the robot's starting position.
 *
 * The value of `x` changes as the Robot moves to the rightwards (increases) or leftwards (decreases) on the field.
 * The value of `y` changes as the Robot moves backwards (decreases) or forwards(increases) on the field.
 * The value of `heading` changes as the Robot turns rightwards (increases towards 180) or leftwards (decreases towards
 * -180);
 *
 * Note, the terms "rightwards", "leftwards", "forwards", and "backwards" are from the perspective of the Robot's
 * starting side on the field. For reference, in the following diagrams "R" marks the starting side of the robot on
 * the field.
